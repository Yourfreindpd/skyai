admission Criteria
for nursery 
(Age 2½ y to 3½ years on July 1) The tiny tots are not subjects to tough test or tricky interviews. An elementary intelligence test is all that the child is required to face. The parents should be educated and have the ability and have attitude to devote time towards the development of the child’s mental faculties.
for K.G. I
(Age 3½ to 4½ years on July 1) These little ones are given simple tests to check elementary intelligence. Knowledge of alphabets, both English and Hindi, recognition of numerals, colors etc. increase the chance of selection of the child. The parents of these children too, should be educated and have the ability and attitude to devote time towards the development of the child’s mental faculties. The little ones are not subjected to tough tests or tricky interviews. The Admissions are given on “First Come First Service” basis. We follow “On the spot admission” as per the age limit. Simple admission procedure is followed and the results are declared there and then itself. For Nursery, KG & I Classes, original Birth Certificate is required and for Class II onward, counter signed Transfer Certificate (TC) and Report Card of the previous school are essential.
for all other classes :-
a test will be taken if student will pass it he will be eligible tc and other official documents are required and age  criteria should be followed
